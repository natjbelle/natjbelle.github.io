Exquisite Corpse: 
A collaborative approach to produce a body of work (drawing, writing etc) collectively. Each person contributes to a hidden composition in sequence, only to be revealed at the end. Popularized as a technique by artists of the Surrealist Movement to generate collaborative compositions.

Let's code it out!
Each part of the body i.e., head, chest, abdomen & limbs must use some shape, animation & variable. Conditionals are optional.


Make sure to name variables as appropriate to the body part to avoid conflicts with other body part's variable names. E.g., headX, limbX etc.
